Access control within Payload is extremely powerful while remaining easy and intuitive to manage. Declaring who should have access to what documents is no more complex than writing a simple JavaScript function that either returns a `boolean` or a [`query`](/docs/queries/overview) constraint to restrict which documents users can interact with.

**Example use cases:**

- Allowing anyone `read` access to all `Post`s
- Only allowing public access to `Post`s where a `status` field is equal to `published`
- Giving only `User`s with a `role` field equal to `admin` the ability to delete `Page`(s)
- Allowing anyone to create `ContactSubmission`s, but only logged in users to `read`, `update` or `delete` them
- Restricting a `User` to only be able to see their own `Order`(s), but no others
- Allowing `User`s that belong to a certain `Organization` to access only that `Organization`'s `Resource`s

### Default Settings

**By default, all Collections and Globals require that a user is logged in to be able to interact in any way.** The default Access Control function evaluates the `user` from the Express `req` and returns `true` if a user is logged in, and `false` if not.

**Default Access function:**

```js
const defaultPayloadAccess = ({ req: { user } }) => {
  // Return `true` if a user is found
  // and `false` if it is undefined or null
  return Boolean(user);
}
```

  <strong>Note:</strong><br/>
  In the Local API, all Access Control functions are skipped by default, allowing your server to do whatever it needs. But, you can opt back in by setting the option <strong>overrideAccess</strong> to <strong>true</strong>.

### Access Control Types

You can manage access within Payload on three different levels:

- [Collections](/docs/access-control/collections)
- [Fields](/docs/access-control/fields)
- [Globals](/docs/access-control/globals)
