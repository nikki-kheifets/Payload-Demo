Field-level hooks offer incredible potential for encapsulating your logic. They help to isolate concerns and package up functionalities to be easily reusable across your projects.

**Example use cases include:**

- Automatically add an `owner` relationship to a Document based on the `req.user.id`
- Encrypt / decrypt a sensitive field using `beforeValidate` and `afterRead` hooks
- Auto-generate field data using a `beforeValidate` hook
- Format incoming data such as kebab-casing a document `slug` with `beforeValidate`
- Restrict updating a document to only once every X hours using the `beforeChange` hook

**All field types provide the following hooks:**

- `beforeValidate`
- `beforeChange`
- `afterChange`
- `afterRead`

## Config

Example field configuration:
```js
{
  name: 'name',
  type: 'text',
  // highlight-start
  hooks: {
    beforeValidate: [(args) => {...}],
    beforeChange: [(args) => {...}],
    afterChange: [(args) => {...}],
    afterRead: [(args) => {...}],
  }
  // highlight-end
}
```

## Arguments and return values

All field-level hooks are formatted to accept the same arguments, although some arguments may be `undefined` based on which field hook you are utilizing.

  <strong>Tip:</strong><br />
  It's a good idea to conditionally scope your logic based on which operation is executing. For example, if you are writing a <strong>beforeChange</strong> hook, you may want to perform different logic based on if the current <strong>operation</strong> is <strong>create</strong> or <strong>update</strong>.

#### Arguments

Field Hooks receive one `args` argument that contains the following properties:

| Option            | Description  |
| ----------------- | -------------|
| **`value`**       | The value of the field. |
| **`data`**        | The data passed to update the field with in `create` and `update` operations, and the full document itself in the `afterRead` hook. |
| **`originalDoc`** | The full original document in `update` operations. |
| **`operation`**   | A string relating to which operation the field type is currently executing within. Useful within `beforeValidate`, `beforeChange`, and `afterChange` hooks to differentiate between `create` and `update` operations. |
| **`req`**         | The Express `request` object. It is mocked for Local API operations. |

#### Return value

All field hooks can optionally modify the return value of the field before the operation continues. Field Hooks may optionally return the value that should be used within the field.

  <strong>Important</strong><br/>
  Due to GraphQL's typed nature, you should never change the type of data that you return from a field, otherwise GraphQL will produce errors. If you need to change the shape or type of data, reconsider Field Hooks and instead evaluate if Collection / Global hooks might suit you better.
